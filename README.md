# Token Launch Guide 🚀

This guide is created based on my real experience in the 2022 bullish era,
where I participated as a **token marketer and host**.

This repository is intended for **educational and legitimate Web3 projects only.**

## 1. Concept & Vision
Before creating a token, you must clearly define:

- What problem does your token solve?
- Who is your target community?
- Is it a utility token, governance token, or meme token?

A token without purpose will not survive long-term.

## 2. Token Basics

- Name:
- Symbol:
- Total Supply:
- Blockchain Network: (BSC / ETH / Polygon / etc)

Example:

Name: MW3 Token  
Symbol: MW3  
Supply: 1,000,000,000  
Network: BSC

## 3. Simple Tokenomics Example

- 40% – Community & Airdrop
- 20% – Development
- 15% – Marketing
- 15% – Liquidity
- 10% – Team

Tokenomics must be transparent to gain trust.
